                  At times, things may seem so overwhelming that we despair of
                  ever recapturing the happiness and optimism that we once may
                  have had. We may find ourselves so anxious about the future or
                  so regretful about the past that the present becomes a very
                  lonely, scary place. <br />
                  You do not have to continue to suffer with chronic worry,
                  obsessional thinking, panic and depression. I can help you
                  regain a stronger sense of control and safety, regain the
                  ability to relax and face the world with renewed confidence.
                  <br />
                  Using evidence based treatment, specifically tailored to your
                  needs, we can work together to identify ways to overcome
