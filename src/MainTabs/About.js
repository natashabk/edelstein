          {"  "}I provide psychotherapy and consultation for individuals, couples and
          families. My work is collaborative and relational. It is important to
          me that I provide a warm and inviting safe space to address anything
          that might be troubling you. The issues I treat are as varied as the
          people who come to see me. I work very hard to understand what brings
          each individual to me, helping to identify the beliefs that we
          developed through our experiences growing up and the coping strategies
          that we develop in order to feel safe. 
          <br/>
          {"  "}Sometimes those strategies have
          been very helpful in getting us to the present and sometimes those
          strategies no longer are adaptive in helping us accomplish our goals.
          Once these beliefs and strategies are conscious, we can alter those
          strategies and thus move forward. Issues that arise may include
          anxiety, generalized and social , trauma of all kinds, developmental
          transitions including grief and bereavement, body image and eating
          disorders, and stress management.
          <br />
          {"  "}Couples most often come to meet with me when they are having conflict
          over and over with no resolution. Sometimes couples come in after
          there has been infidelity, either to heal the relationship or separate
          in a way that will still allow them to minimize the damage to their
          children and co-parent .With children, I provide help in dealing with
          fear, sadness, anxieties about the future,and bullying. Parents can
          get help in positive discipline and dealing with oppositional
          behaviors. We work together to understand how children think and feel
          so that they feel understood and supported.
          <br />
          {"  "}Adolescence is a time of growth and change, both of which can be very
          exciting and very stressful for everybody involved. Teenagers face
          social stress, academic and college stress, issues of sexuality and
          gender. Substance abuse, over reliance on social media, coping
          strategies that include self harm can be turned in a positive
          direction. Oppositional behavior and anger can be understood and
          rechanneled.
          <br />
          {"  "}With over twenty five years as a clinical psychologist , I still
          really enjoy my practice and my approach reflects my personal
          satisfaction. The work is endlessly fascinating and challenging and I
          consider it an honor be able to help people find their way back to
          joy. I welcome you to my practice.
